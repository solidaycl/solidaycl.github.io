## Description
Meet Archie, the "wannabe pro" hunting dog who takes every outing with Sam as a chance to prove he’s got what it takes… even if he’s still figuring out which end of a stick goes in his mouth. Archie’s got boundless enthusiasm, a flair for dramatic zoomies, and a unique strategy of scaring squirrels off with his own high-pitched yelps before they even get close. Sam’s training him to be a real hunting dog, but so far, Archie’s only excelled in sniffing out snacks and getting covered in mud.
