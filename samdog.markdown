## Description

Sam is a field bred black labrador retriever. At home, he’s a professional napper, sprawled out in any position needed to nudge you off the couch. But once he's outside, it’s a whole different story, he turns into a high-energy explorer, whether he’s leaping in a dock diving contest, chasing squirrels, or swimming in lakes scaring the fish. Sam's outdoor adventures are nonstop, while his indoor hobbies mostly involve finding the coziest spot to snooze.
