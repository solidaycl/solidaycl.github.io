# Charlie

### DOB
July, 2021

## Description
Meet Charlie, the poodle who’s more cat than dog. He might not be fully committed to the adventure lifestyle, but he sure knows how to get himself dirty in the mud and briar bushes. Charlie is all about fun, but only as long as it doesn’t interfere with his relaxing time. He’s not be swimming across rivers like Sam, but if there’s a tasty treat involved, you can bet Charlie is all in.
